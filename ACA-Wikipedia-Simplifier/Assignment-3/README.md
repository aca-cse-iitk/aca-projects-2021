Hello, @everyone ! For the second week, we start with Neural Networks. For this, we want you to go through the videos on this course: https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning?#syllabus 
You just need to watch Week 3 and Week 4 for the purpose of this project, rest is your choice. You’ll be required to implement a neural network from scratch in python. Implement the two-input AND boolean function using it. Input will be X = [(0,0),(0,1),(1,0),(1,1)] and it’ll be trained to given the corresponding output, y = [0,0,0,1].
Besides this, to ensure that you understand the working of NNs, each team will be allotted 10 minutes, and you have to present in your own words how a neural network works. You can use any visual aid to help you in your presentation.
