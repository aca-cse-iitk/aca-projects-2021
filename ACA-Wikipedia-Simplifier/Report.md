**TASK**
1. Build a 'Trie' (a tree based structure for storing strings) and the respective functions in python. <br>[Link to task1](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis192/tliu/hws/hw1.html)

2. Build the word guessing game 'Hangman' using the given template in python. <br>[Link to task2](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/assignments/)

## Week-2
The objective of this week was to introduce the students to the `Basics of Neural Networks` along with techniques like linear regression and gradient descent.

**TASK**
1. Build a model for predicting the output of 'AND' of two bits. Input was be X = [(0,0),(0,1),(1,0),(1,1)] and was to be trained to give the corresponding output, y = [0,0,0,1].

2. The teams were to prepare a 10 minute presentation to explain Neural Networks in their own words. The aim of this task was to judge their understanding of neural networks.

## Week-3
This time the students were introduced to `Recurrent Neural Networks` and its various features and functions like `GRUs` and `LSTM`. Along with this, they were also intoduced to `Keras` and `Tensorflow` the basic tech-stack for Machine Learning.

**TASK**
1. Implement a machine learning model using RNN to predict wether a given review was positive or negative. Use a dataset provided by tensorflow and train the model accordingly. Finally calculate the accuracy of the model on a set of unkown test data, provided by the dataset.
