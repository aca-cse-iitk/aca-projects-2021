# Introduction to Competitive Programming
#### May 16, 2021

Work done in the first month of project

# Learning C++/Setting up environment: 
Resources were shared with the mentees to get them acquainted with C++ as it is the most commonly used programming language for competitive programming. Tutorials were also shared on how to set up a local environment. Mentees were also informed on competitive programming ethics, templates to be used.
# Topic-1 STL Library:
 Blogs were shared on the most commonly used functions and data types from the STL library.
# Topic-2 Binary Exponentiation and Prefix Sum:
Resources on the prefix sum and exponentiation techniques were shared. Also, practice problems related to the topic were provided to mentees.
# Topic-3 Sorting:
Commonly used sorting algorithm techniques were shared with mentees and some problems which used sorting as a subroutine were also given to them for practice.
# Contests:
 Along with blogs and tutorials, we made mashups/contests for students. The first contest was a 3 day long contest with basic CP questions and the questions were based on basic programming. The second contest was based on using STL.
